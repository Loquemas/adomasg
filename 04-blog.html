            humanity 18/01/2024.
            To keep it short but simple. 
            Nothing good ever came from inaction. 
            I’d rather be going in the wrong direction, but in a direction nonetheless. 
            If my issue comes from building things computers can build better, 
            that is a mistake I’ll live with. I refuse to be paralysed with inactivity, 
            I know I won’t be punished for attempting to learn. 
            There should be and is some importance assigned to humanity 
            and things built by ourselves. This constant flip flopping 
            between careers that don’t exist yet is exhausting, but the inability 
            to adapt has the potential to bury any work that I produce. 
            I think I’m led to believe that who knows technology better than 
            technology itself, but I’m not sure I believe that fully.
             It’s like saying, who knows carpentry better than a tree. 
             In the time where I can produce a perfect note from a saxophone 
             pressing a single button or having Louis Armstrong avatar
              play in the comfort of my home, there is still something wonderful 
              about the acoustic notes that escape an instrument in person from a 
              maestro in front of you. I may be being sentimental about lines 
              of code of projects, however Usain Bolt doesn’t stop me from sprinting
              , LeBron James doesn’t stop me from playing basketball 
              and Einstein doesn’t stop my love for physics.
               Comparison is humanity and just because the 
               competition has grown, my effort will not stop, nor will my work 
               because it is all I have.</p>
